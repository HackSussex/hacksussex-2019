# Website Design Plan

The HackSussex 2019 will be a single-page website. All the content will be in their
respective sections, rather than being on separate pages.

## Base Content
Content that should be generally available from the first version of the website

### Section 1: Front Page
- HackSussex banner
- Date and Time of Hackathon (short)
- Perhaps a motto or short paragraph that expresses who and what we are (a fun hackathon).
- A **PHAT** "apply" button

### Section 2: Long description
- More information about who we are and what the hackathon is all about
- Keypoints that people would like to know, at a glance:
  - Exact date, time, and location (with link to FAQ for location). More info than on the front page
  - How long the hackathon will be for
  - What hackers should expect, especially considering previous hackathons
  - Link to previous hackathon after-videos

### Section 3: Challenges
- Explanation of how our challenges work
- Mention that you're not allowed to start before the hackathon
- Individual pop-boxes that show a few previous challenges (and who hosted them)
- Don't know if we should include previous prizes for each challenge as well

### Section 4: Sponsors
- This is where we put all our current sponsors, with their own icons

### Section 5: FAQ
- How do I get to the event? (with tiny embedded map)
- How long is the hackathon?
- What to expect from start to tend?
- What should I bring as a hacker?
- Do I have to pay for anything?
- Do you have vegan / gluten / dairy / meat free food?
- I can't access eduroam. How do I get online?
- Is the venue accessible?
- I don't have / can't make a team. Is that ok?

## Addon Content
Content that we can add after we flesh them out

### Section 3.5: Hackathon schedule
- Run-of-the-show of the hackathon to-be.
- Maybe we could have a live timeline, showing exactly what's happening? On the day of the event
that is. At lunch it would hover over lunch, etc.
- The schedule is a bit long and tedious to scroll down. The collapse button should follow it down the screen.
